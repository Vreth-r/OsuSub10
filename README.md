# Osu! Sub 10

This was a challenge project to code a clone of Osu! in under 10 hours. The official time including development, debugging, and building took **9.4 hours**.

The project includes 3 (poorly made) beatmaps to play, the unbuilt unity project contains a beatmap editor that can be used to make custom beatmaps.

The code is messy and far from my best work but this is essentially a test of my immediate dev knowledge that I can pull out of my brain quickly plus a display of how fast I can work and still have something out thats playable.
