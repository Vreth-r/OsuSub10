# Osu! Sub 10

This was a challenge project to code a clone of Osu! in under 10 hours. The official time including development, debugging, and building took **9.4 hours**.

The project includes 3 (poorly made) beatmaps to play, the unbuilt unity project contains a beatmap editor that can be used to make custom beatmaps.
